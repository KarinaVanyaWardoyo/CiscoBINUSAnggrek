# Cisco Packet Tracer of BINUS University Anggrek Campus's 3rd,4th and 5th Floor 
Made a virtual and simulated environment of BINUS University Anggrek Campus's 3rd, 4th, 5th floor where we can design, build, and test computer networks without needing physical hardware.

# Network Topology
We chose an Extended Star Topology, where each floor has its own switches and routers connected to a central router and server. This topology was selected due to its scalability, cost efficiency, and ease of adding new devices without disrupting existing connections.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a scalable and efficient university network using extended star topology, DHCP-based IP allocation, static routing, and application layer services to support academic activities.
